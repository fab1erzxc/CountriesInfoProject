# CountriesInfoProject\

The purpose of this project was to collect, analyze and visualize data on all countries of the world from the site scrapethissite.com . To collect data, I used python libraries such as requests and BeautifulSoup4 and pandas to write data to a dataframe and a CSV file. I also used such libraries as pandas, matplotlib, numpy and geopandas for analysis and visualization. I believe that the project was successful and all the goals were achieved.
